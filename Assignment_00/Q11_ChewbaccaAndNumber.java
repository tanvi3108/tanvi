    /*The logic behind this Problem was pretty simple as we can invert any digit ( 9 - digit) 
    but we need to invert only such digits that will eventually end up giving the smallest number possible.
So, we should invert only digits greater then or equal to 5 as after inverting them, the result gives us smallest number.
For e.g.,
9 - 5 = 4 viz, smaller than the original number that was 5.
9 - 8 = 1 viz, smaller than the original number that was 8.
but 9 - 1 = 8 viz, greater than the original number that was 1.
Important point to consider is, After inverting any digits their should not be trailing zeros that means,
 if their is 9 at the starting of the number then it must remain the same
Also input can be quite big so, u need to capture the number in long long int in c++ and long in java.
